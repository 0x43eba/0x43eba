Project Overviews:

- Whistle: After spending a few days troubleshooting missing documentation for Clojure's web crawling libraries, I decided to write my own lisp implementation for web crawling. Wheather or not it ended up saving me any time is an open question. This one is my favorite project.
- Modelia: This project contains a neural network framework I developed when trying to make a convincing text-generation bot through implementations of known neural network models. While the text generation models themselves came out sounding a little weird, the code itself is pretty cool.
- Oculo: A flask like web framework built in TypeScript using inversion of control to produce a very fun developer experience. I typically use this as the backbone for any website I build now.
- Obdisian-Iris: My partner needed a way to copy her incomplete to-do tasks between note pages in Obsidian Markdown. All other options were broken, so I created this, and got a few users along the way!
- Artomatic: An elixer script to automatically set your desktop wallpaper from ArtPip's API endpoint.
- Crawler-kit: A framework for web crawling which abstracts away all the repetitive parts of crawling the web. You plug in your script, run the program and get your data! Open the src folder to take a look at how it works, entry point is the composition root.
Most of my pinned projects are in TypeScript, which is my favorite prototyping language because it has so many librares available. I write my TS like it's C# however. Some of my other repos are in other languages, including Clojure, C# (I work in this professionally), Python and Javascript. I can work in most object oriented, strictly typed languages like C# and Java. I'm also comfortable with functional programming, including the more whacky stuff like monadic functions.
