Project Overviews:

- modelia: This project contains a neural network framework I developed when trying to make a convincing text-generation bot through implementations of known neural network models. While the text generation models themselves came out sounding very unbelievable, the code itself is pretty cool.
- Whistle: After spending a few days troubleshooting missing documentation for Clojure's web crawling libraries, I decided to write my own lisp implementation for web crawling. Wheather or not it ended up saving me any time is an open question.
